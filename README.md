# Trendy Tunes

# This is the final project for Amitesh Kataria, Joy Phillips, Aislinn Jeske, and Mary Elizabeth Ward for UW's Info 201. 

## We used the Spotify API to get information about users, artists, tracks, and trending music. You can see our work [here](https://aislinnjeske.shinyapps.io/info201-final-project/)
